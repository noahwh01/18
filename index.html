<p id = "par">It all started with Noah feeling sick in the car in the US so Mummy said that Deer had lots of ketchup bottles. She would call us and complain that there wasn’t enough ketchup so in the end Deer had all the ketchup in the world. She put it on the softoys’ food because they liked it. Now she makes casseroles out of the bio-bin, where leftovers and waste food goes.</p>
